            Hi my name is Mathieu Gauthron, I have been involved with BrokerCompare, an inovative
						price comparison start-up for now over a year.
						Today I want to share with you some of the design choices, the reasons and the benefits choosing Clojure brought to Broker Compare.

						Let me give you some background:
						BrokerCompare provides a price comparison widget for ISA and SIPP stock and share brokering platforms.
						Typically a user interested in managing their savings will read an article from one of the main content providers like,
						ThisIsMoney, MoneyForTheMasses, Uswitch
						The user answers a series of questions about their investment profile. [next] Then the comparison engines returns a list of
						suitable providers sorted by cost
						, provides a breakdown of costs and additional qualitative information before the user decides whether to open an account or not.

					<h3>Start-ups - cost &  time to market</h3>
          <img  src="img/1000_questions_startup_need_to_answer.jpg" alt="how_to_start_a_startup">
				 <aside class="notes">
            A start-up like BrokerCompare needs to make many important choices to become successful. Choosing the development language which will be used to implement
						the main service of the business can be tricky. Especially for a founders who don't
            Necesserally have the IT knowledge to appreciate the subtle difference and advantage of one technological stack over another.

						Let's face it, business owners are not interested in language beauty. Whether the language is homoiconic, imutable, functional, etc...

						Start-ups want to run on minimal cost and be quick to reach a market.

						There are a various mainstream technologies out there which are widely used, proven, cheap to resource for and quick to develop with.
					  As business owner why would you not stick with them?

						When I joined BrokerCompare, I found a backend and front end developed in PHP, React and a bog standard MySQL database.

					 I know what your going to say, but actually
					 it made total sense at the time. The product was functional.
					 It was developed in no time and the resources based in Ukraine were resonably priced, keeping the burning cost low.
					 Everyone knows PHP, hiring more PHP developer would never be an issue.

					 In a nutshell PHP was a success...

					 Except for one thing: Sprawling Complexity

						One thing I forgot to say, start-ups also need something else crucial to their success:
						They need agility because they don't know in advance how they will need to adapt their features to leverage a newly discovered market.
						Having built a pilot quickly can prove to be challenging in face of the need for rapid changes.

						Suddenly the technical debt was catching up with BrokerCompare.
						Managing the duplicated code needed to manage multiple content providers was making new feature development
						slow, inconsistent and error prone. After an initial code review, we decided that extracting
						the business logic out from PHP and rewriting into a Clojure backend was the best way to solve the development
						challengies the company faced.

					## Technology Stack  at BrokerCompare

					* PHP + React front end
					* Clojure REST service - based on Catacumba
					* MongoDB - business rule definitions
					* MySQL - storage of the transactions
					note:


					Here is what we built after the introduction of Clojure.
					For practical reasons the front end was kept in PHP and React, a REST service backend was written in Clojure,
					a MongoDB for business rule definitions and MySQL database for storage of the transactions.

Business domain DSL definition with Spec

	                    }})
```
note:

I'm going to show you a few code excerpts to give you a feel for how some of the feature were useful to us
.
Here, you can see an example of DSL that was created using Spec to define the semantic of
a stock and share broker platform.
One of them is Fidelity. just draw your attention to how the fee structure of the :funds and :shares are
expressed using a rich semantic.

					```clojure
(def Fidelity-fees
 {:name  "Fidelity",
	:account {:holding {:funds {:rates [[0 7499.99 0.0035 "cancel-if-no-regular-dealing"]

                              :type  "percentage-all"}
                      :shares {:rates [[0 7499.99 0.0] [7500 Infinity 0.0035]]

                               ::opening-and-periodic-exclusive))
(s/def ::account ::single-account)
```
note:
The grammar of this semantic is defined with a tree of Specs. You can see on this example,
how an :account is composed of :holding -> :shares -> :rates :max :type. See how the :rate is defined
with a :segment. the segment is composed of for values :low :high :value and an :option.

Spec provides validation out of the box
```clojure
(s/valid? ::form-data form-data)
```
note:
Not only do you get the grammar so you can validate your data throughout your program [next page].

here s/valid? is the spec function that validate the form data input coming through the rest interface

But it also provides very high level semantic for testing properties [next page].

				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
Spec provides validation out of the box
```clojure
(defspec test-form-data->portfolio-investments-split-properly-trading
	(for-all [portfolio-form-data (s/gen ::portfolio/form-data)]
		(let [portfolio (form-data->portfolio portfolio-form-data)]
			(investments-split-properly-trading? portfolio-form-data portfolio))))
```
note:
Here we can the specification of  invariant propertes which exist between the
submitted form-data and the portfolio object.

Spec also provides explanations [next page].

				</section>


				<section data-markdown>
Spec provides explanation out of the box
```clojure
(facts "form data -> portfolio is valid"
   (tabular (fact "basic"
     (s/explain-str ::portfolio/portfolio (second (form-data->portfolio ?form-data))) => success)
            ?form-data
						myform
						...))

```
note:
Here the s/explain-str function explains to the developer what was wrong in the form-data in case the test fails

Midje - tabular facts
```clojure
(facts "First-Year Cost - Scalar"
  (tabular (fact "ISA only with no account charge - Hargreaves Lansdown"
    (first-year-cost-scalar

note:
Midje provides a nice tabular source of facts that can be tested.
Here we are testing the function first-year-cost-scala with parameterized by this table.

					 Let's recap:
					 Although a typical experienced Clojure developer's hourly rate tends to be higher than a PHP's,
					 choosing Clojure provided key benefits which offset that fact. Clojure holds
					 strong principles with regards to simplicity. It's not just the language itself, it's the ethos that created by it accross the community which
					 creates a virtue cycle. The language is simple, minimalistic, in search high expressivity and elegance. This attracts
					 likeminded developers who care. Who cares about minimal design, code re-use and business domain expressivity.

					 That's how Yehonathan managed to
					 * develop a backend prototype in around 2 weeks
					 * reduce 150K LOC down to 2K LOC
					 * provided a business domain DSL with spec
					 * self-testing framework with spec generators
